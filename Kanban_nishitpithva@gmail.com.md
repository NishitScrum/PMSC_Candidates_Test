## Q1:**What is Kanban System ?** 


**Difficulty:** `Junior`

**Answer:**
Every kanban system is also a **pull system**. It means that people engaged in certain work **decide themselves** when to pull the next task and this is the opposite of a push system where work is assigned to them.
Let's imagine a Project Manager assigns 10 tasks to somebody this is a PUSH system. When people decide when to pull work it is the PULL system. Also, a printer is a pull system. A printer **"decides itself"** when to pull the next task - if one sheet is printed on, then the printer has an "empty slot" and it pulls the next sheet. This is how you can imagine it.
I made a little simplification when defining pull systems but I promise there will be a separate post about 5 different pull systems. And then I will explain it in more detail. For now, I can tell you one thing, kanban is the king of all pull systems!
Kanban pull system is based on WORK IN PROGRESS LIMITS (WIP limits). Each flow phase, or, in the case of the kanban board, each column, must have a proper WIP limit.
What is also important here is that there must be active states in the flow divided with passive states also called ques. Imagine a programmer finished his work and if he moves it to the "Testing in Progress" column right away - it is a push system. There has to be a "Ready for Testing" state a queue from which testers can pull.
Here is one more thing, maybe obvious but in 80% of cases ignored - there has to be commitment and delivery point - very clearly defined beginning and end of the system. It is really important from the perspective of lead times/cycle times - I will tell you about measuring in Kanban system for sure in the different post but what I want to tell you now, till we don't have a well-defined beginning and end, we have a very lame or disabled kanban system. So summing up, a board is a physical or electronic representation of a system.

## Q2: **What is Scrumban ?**
**Difficulty**: `Mid`

**Answer:**
Well, let's get to the next part, which is, Scrumban. Corey Ladas, an author of the concept, was of the opinion that teams that effectively adopted Scrum, should go further in development. Should go into Kanban Method. Personally, I don't think that Scrum or Kanban is in a kind of hierarchy, that one is better or worse, these are just different approaches. Anyway, that was his opinion. So at first, this Scrumban meant Kanban which originates from Scrum but this concept faded away very quickly.
Nowadays, everyone who has any hybrid of Scrum and Kanban on their mind uses this word. The concept of hybrid is rather cool I would say but it looks a bit different in practice. In fact, it looks terrible each time. We usually deal with something similar to a Frankenstein monster.
9 out of 10 cases look like that - we cannot do the proper Scrum, so let's get rid of Sprints, retrospective, and review because they are uncomfortable and let's start working in Kanban, let's do boards, but, in fact, work in progress limits are also uncomfortable for us so let's get rid of them as well because why would we want to use them? In practice, Scrumban means "comfortable" process - but the empirical process can't be comfortable! It should be very painful when we do wrong things! Scrumban usually is **anti-empirical**, it kills any empiricism which we would need!

## Q3: **Professional Scrum with Kanban Explain in Detail ?**


**Difficulty**: `Senior`

**Source:** https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/blogvlog-7-meanings-kanban-what-kanban-all-about
 

**Answer:**
So let's get to the last sort of kanban - it is called the Professional Scrum with Kanban (PSK). The temple of Scrum, Scrum.org created its own version of Kanban which is adapted to let say upgrade the already existing Scrum. 
What's important, PSK - Professional Scrum with Kanban is **100%** Scrum. It contains part of the elements from the Kanban Method but it is still a 100-percent Scrum. It contains these elements from the Kanban method which are not covered by Scrum. So if Scrum covers something, it is not, let's say duplicated or overwritten. For example, in Kanban Method, there is a practice called: "Establish feedback loops" it is not present in PSK because Scrum covers feedback loops with Scrum Events. Also in Kanban Method, there is a practice called: "Improve Collaboratively Evolve Experimentally" - it is also not present in PSK because in Scrum it is covered by Inspection and Adaptation.
What's important, as the Kanban Method is an evolutionary approach, the PSK is more like in Scrum so it is a kind of revolution. We do have to do a transformation to have Scrum and then from Scrum, we can go further to additionally implement Kanban to optimize it, to make it even more efficient, focused more on the flow.
